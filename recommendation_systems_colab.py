"""# II. Preliminaries

Our goal is to factorize the ratings matrix $A$ into the product of a user embedding matrix $U$ and movie embedding matrix $V$, such that $A \approx UV^\top$ with
$U = \begin{bmatrix} u_{1} \\ \hline \vdots \\ \hline u_{N} \end{bmatrix}$ and
$V = \begin{bmatrix} v_{1} \\ \hline \vdots \\ \hline v_{M} \end{bmatrix}$.

Here
- $N$ is the number of users,
- $M$ is the number of movies,
- $A_{ij}$ is the rating of the $j$th movies by the $i$th user,
- each row $U_i$ is a $d$-dimensional vector (embedding) representing user $i$,
- each row $V_j$ is a $d$-dimensional vector (embedding) representing movie $j$,
- the prediction of the model for the $(i, j)$ pair is the dot product $\langle U_i, V_j \rangle$.

## Sparse Representation of the Rating Matrix

The rating matrix could be very large and, in general, most of the entries are unobserved, since a given user will only rate a small subset of movies. For effcient representation, we will use a [tf.SparseTensor](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/SparseTensor). A `SparseTensor` uses three tensors to represent the matrix: `tf.SparseTensor(indices, values, dense_shape)` represents a tensor, where a value $A_{ij} = a$ is encoded by setting `indices[k] = [i, j]` and `values[k] = a`. The last tensor `dense_shape` is used to specify the shape of the full underlying matrix.

#### Toy example
Assume we have $2$ users and $4$ movies. Our toy ratings dataframe has three ratings,

user\_id | movie\_id | rating
--:|--:|--:
0 | 0 | 5.0
0 | 1 | 3.0
1 | 3 | 1.0

The corresponding rating matrix is

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
5.0 & 3.0 & 0 & 0 \\
0   &   0 & 0 & 1.0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

And the SparseTensor representation is,
```python
SparseTensor(
  indices=[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1,3]],
  values=[5.0, 3.0, 1.0],
  dense_shape=[2, 4])
```

### Exercise 1: Build a tf.SparseTensor representation of the Rating Matrix.

In this exercise, we'll write a function that maps from our `ratings` DataFrame to a `tf.SparseTensor`.

Hint: you can select the values of a given column of a Dataframe `df` using `df['column_name'].values`.
"""

def build_rating_sparse_tensor(ratings_df):
  """
  Args:
    ratings_df: a pd.DataFrame with `user_id`, `movie_id` and `rating` columns.
  Returns:
    a tf.SparseTensor representing the ratings matrix.
  """
  indices = ratings_df[['user_id', 'movie_id']].values
  values = ratings_df['rating'].values
  return tf.SparseTensor(
      indices=indices,
      values=values,
      dense_shape=[users.shape[0], movies.shape[0]])

"""## Calculating the error

The model approximates the ratings matrix $A$ by a low-rank product $UV^\top$. We need a way to measure the approximation error. We'll start by using the Mean Squared Error of observed entries only (we will revisit this later). It is defined as

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{MSE}(A, UV^\top)
&= \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\sum_{(i, j) \in\Omega}{( A_{ij} - (UV^\top)_{ij})^2} \\
&= \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\sum_{(i, j) \in\Omega}{( A_{ij} - \langle U_i, V_j\rangle)^2}
\end{align*}
$$
where $\Omega$ is the set of observed ratings, and $|\Omega|$ is the cardinality of $\Omega$.

### Exercise 2: Mean Squared Error

Write a TensorFlow function that takes a sparse rating matrix $A$ and the two embedding matrices $U, V$ and returns the mean squared error $\text{MSE}(A, UV^\top)$.

Hints:
  * in this section, we only consider observed entries when calculating the loss.
  * a `SparseTensor` `sp_x` is a tuple of three Tensors: `sp_x.indices`, `sp_x.values` and `sp_x.dense_shape`.
  * you may find [`tf.gather_nd`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gather_nd) and  [`tf.losses.mean_squared_error`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/losses/mean_squared_error) helpful.

For the MovieLens dataset, this is fine, as the dense $N \times M$ matrix is small enough to fit in memory ($N = 943$, $M = 1682$).

Another approach (given in the alternate solution below) is to only gather the embeddings of the observed pairs, then compute their dot products. The memory cost is $O(|\Omega| d)$ where $d$ is the embedding dimension. In our case, $|\Omega| = 10^5$, and the embedding dimension is on the order of $10$, so the memory cost of both methods is comparable.

- a loss to optimize (a `tf.Tensor`).
- an optional list of metrics dictionaries, each mapping a string (the name of the metric) to a tensor. These are evaluated and plotted during training (e.g. training error and test error).

After training, one can access the trained embeddings using the `model.embeddings` dictionary.

Example usage:
```
U_var = ...
V_var = ...
loss = ...

### Exercise 5: Write a function that computes the scores of the candidates
We start by writing a function that, given a query embedding $u \in \mathbb R^d$ and item embeddings $V \in \mathbb R^{N \times d}$, computes the item scores.

As discussed in the lecture, there are different similarity measures we can use, and these can yield different results. We will compare the following:
- dot product: the score of item j is $\langle u, V_j \rangle$.
- cosine: the score of item j is $\frac{\langle u, V_j \rangle}{\|u\|\|V_j\|}$.

Hints:
- you can use [`np.dot`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html) to compute the product of two np.Arrays.
- you can use [`np.linalg.norm`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html) to compute the norm of a np.Array.

## Movie Embedding Norm

We can also observe that the recommendations with dot-product and cosine are different: with dot-product, the model tends to recommend popular movies. This can be explained by the fact that in matrix factorization models, the norm of the embedding is often correlated with popularity (popular movies have a larger norm), which makes it more likely to recommend more popular items. We can confirm this hypothesis by sorting the movies by their embedding norm, as done in the next cell.

We can observe that the embeddings do not seem to have any notable structure, and the embeddings of a given genre are located all over the embedding space. This confirms the poor quality of the learned embeddings. One of the main reasons, which we will address in the next section, is that we only trained the model on observed pairs, and without regularization.

# V. Regularization In Matrix Factorization

In the previous section, our loss was defined as the mean squared error on the observed part of the rating matrix.  As discussed in the lecture, this can be problematic as the model does not learn how to place the embeddings of irrelevant movies. This phenomenon is known as *folding*.

We will add regularization terms that will address this issue. We will use two types of regularization:
- Regularization of the model parameters. This is a common $\ell_2$ regularization term on the embedding matrices, given by $r(U, V) =  \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \|U_i\|^2 + \frac{1}{M}\sum_j \|V_j\|^2$.
- A global prior that pushes the prediction of any pair towards zero, called the *gravity* term. This is given by $g(U, V) = \frac{1}{MN} \sum_{i = 1}^N \sum_{j = 1}^M \langle U_i, V_j \rangle^2$.

The total loss is then given by
$$
\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\sum_{(i, j) \in \Omega} (A_{ij} - \langle U_i, V_j\rangle)^2 + \lambda _r r(U, V) + \lambda_g g(U, V)
$$
where $\lambda_r$ and $\lambda_g$ are two regularization coefficients (hyper-parameters).

This concludes this section on matrix factorization models.
